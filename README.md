# Welcome to My GitHub Profile 👋

Hello there! I'm **Marcelo Junior**, a recent graduate in **Data Science** from NOVA Information Management School with an Erasmus stint at Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne. 

I specialise in machine learning and image classification using Python, but I also have a solid grasp of R, SQL, and Excel. When I'm not analysing data, I'm probably watching Formula 1, playing RPGs, or trying to rank up in Valorant (with mixed results).

### 🛠️ Projects
Here are a few highlights of what I've been working on:

- **[Melanoma Classification through images with TensorFlow](https://github.com/MarceloJ18/ProjectsRepo/tree/main/Deep-Learning-Project-main)**
  - Trained a CNN to identify skin cancer cases from images, applying some image processing methods.

- **[Customer Segmentation in Python](https://github.com/MarceloJ18/ProjectsRepo/tree/main/MachineLearning2Project-main)**
  - Used machine learning to segmentate customers into groups, creating also association rules for their purchases.
